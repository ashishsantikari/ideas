[{"content":"Dear Readers, welcome to my blog. I hope you are okay in this Corona Pandemic, I am certainly doing good too. You seldom open my blog site because I rarely write. Believe me, I am trying my best to change that.\nAttention !!! Oh! BTW, I will be experimenting with the colors on my blog site for a nicer experience. I would be happy to hear from you. Click [this](mailto:hi@ashishsantikari.info?subject=Feedback on the website) and send me a quick email feedback, if you would like to.\nMy Take I would like to share my experience on Sony WH-bla-bla-M3. The name is so confusing. It should have a nice name, like killer-X or something. Samsung\u0026rsquo;s products have wonderful series. S8 S9 S10 S10+ etc. Apple also have their line up. iPhone 5, iPhone 6, iPhone 7 etc.. Whay is 1000 so significant? If you have the answer, let me know by clicking [this](mailto:hi@ashishsantikari.info?subject=What\u0026rsquo;s missing on Sony WH-1000XM3).\nBut, these headphones are sick, dude!. If someone is still interested in getting these headphones(if they are available at a cheaper rate right now), I would say go on. Worth the penny. I really love the noise cancellation feature and the various other modes present. It blows me away with the performance of producing the white noise. I also love the touch pad on the right side which is so amazing and has that additional style factor.\nThe Trick Now, the feature of toggling the various modes of the headphones is very much limited to mobile connectivity and not computers(PC/Mac/Linux). You don\u0026rsquo;t have the software like the Headphones app that is required for you to toggle between the various sound modes in the headphones. But, I figured out a way to achieve this. You just miss upon the Google Assistant/Alexa integration which is quite okay for a deal like this. \u0026ldquo;Sony, do you hear a product feedback? #backlog #productfeedback\u0026rdquo;.\nAnyway, for this, you need to have the headphones paired on with the \u0026ldquo;Headphones app\u0026rdquo;. Once in the app, go to System -\u0026gt; Change function of [NC/AMBIENT] button to Ambient Sound control. By default, it comes with Google Assistant trigger button. And Voila!\nTry pressing the [NC/AMBIENT] button to toggle through all the modes and also when, you are connected to any bluetooth devices even computers(PC/Mac/Linux).\n","permalink":"https://blog.ashishsantikari.info/posts/review-sony-wh-1000xm3/","summary":"Dear Readers, welcome to my blog.

As I was unsure about what should I write about, here I am writing about my one of my favourite function, the reducer function.\nAt first, newbies may feel this is a big topic to cover or can be very trick to understand but it is not. In fact, it is very simple and you may be take maybe 5 minutes or less to understand its implementation in your code.\nLets say you need to write a program where you will be provided with an array of numbers and you need to print the squares of each of the numbers. I believe you may write the code which is similar to the code below, right?\nNow, using the same logic, letâ€™s rewrite the code using a reduce function.\nPretty easy to understand, right? Actually, it is!\nReducer takes a callback function as an argument which accepts two values : accumulator and the element. Accumulator, as the name suggests, accumulates the value after operating over each element. Operation is decided by you. I have used it to square the number in the above example. You can do almost anything if your logic has the condition to loop over the array.\nAdditionally, I have provided an empty array [] after the callback function. That is an optional argument, which is the initial value of the aggregator.\nCompare the two programs below and let me know the difference!\nHope you guys liked my first blog post!
