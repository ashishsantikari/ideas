Hi Guys,

This is my first blog post. As I was unsure about what should I write about, here I am writing about my one of my favourite function, the reducer function.

At first, newbies may feel this is a big topic to cover or can be very trick to understand but it is not. In fact, it is very simple and you may be take maybe 5 minutes or less to understand its implementation in your code.

Lets say you need to write a program where you will be provided with an array of numbers and you need to print the squares of each of the numbers. I believe you may write the code which is similar to the code below, right?

Now, using the same logic, letâ€™s rewrite the code using a reduce function.

Pretty easy to understand, right? Actually, it is!

Reducer takes a callback function as an argument which accepts two values : accumulator and the element. Accumulator, as the name suggests, accumulates the value after operating over each element. Operation is decided by you. I have used it to square the number in the above example. You can do almost anything if your logic has the condition to loop over the array.

Additionally, I have provided an empty array [] after the callback function. That is an optional argument, which is the initial value of the aggregator.

Compare the two programs below and let me know the difference!

Hope you guys liked my first blog post! Thanks for reading!
