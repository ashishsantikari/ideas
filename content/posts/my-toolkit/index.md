Every person has there own set of tools that he/she likes while working.
I too have some favourites tools that impacts me a lot to my productivity.
I am jotting down those below. These are my personal preference and not endorsements.

1. A 24 inch monitor
2. [Apple Magic Keyboard][apple-magic-keyboard] (I will be soon moving to mechanical keyboard, and will provide a review of the same)
3. [Sony WH-1000XM3 headphones][sony-wh1000xm3] Best noise cancellation headphones I have used so far
4. [Logitech M720 Triathlon mouse][logitech-m720]
5. [IntelliJ Idea Ultimate][intellij-idea]
6. [iTerm][iterm]
7. [Clipy][clipy]
