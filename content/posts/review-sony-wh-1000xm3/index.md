Dear Readers, welcome to my blog. I hope you are okay in this Corona Pandemic, I am certainly doing good too.
You seldom open my blog site because I rarely write. Believe me, I am trying my best
to change that.

## Attention !!!

Oh! BTW, **I will be experimenting with the colors** on my blog site for a nicer experience.
I would be happy to hear from you. Click [this](mailto:hi@ashishsantikari.info?subject=Feedback) on the website and
send me a quick email feedback, if you would like to.

## My Take

I would like to share my experience on _Sony WH-bla-bla-M3_. The name is so confusing.
It should have a nice name, like killer-X or something. Samsung's products have wonderful series.
S8 S9 S10 S10+ etc. Apple also have their line up. iPhone 5, iPhone 6, iPhone 7 etc..
Whay is 1000 so significant? If you have the answer, let me know by clicking [this](mailto:hi@ashishsantikari.info?subject=What's%20missing%20on%20Sony%20WH-1000XM3).

But, these headphones are sick, dude!. If someone is still interested in getting these headphones(if they are available
at a cheaper rate right now), I would say go on. Worth the penny. I really love the noise cancellation feature and
the various other modes present. It blows me away with the performance of producing the white noise.
I also love the touch pad on the right side which is so amazing and has that additional style
factor.

## The Trick

Now, the feature of toggling the various modes of the headphones is very much limited to mobile connectivity and not
computers(PC/Mac/Linux). You don't have the software like the [Headphones][app] app that
is required for you to toggle between
the various sound modes in the headphones. But, I figured out a way to achieve this.
You just miss upon the Google Assistant/Alexa integration which is quite okay for a deal like this.
"Sony, do you hear a product feedback? #backlog #productfeedback".

Anyway, for this, you need to have the headphones paired on with the ["Headphones app"][app]. Once in the app,
go to System -> Change function of _[NC/AMBIENT]_ button to Ambient Sound control. By default, it comes with
Google Assistant trigger button. And Voila!

Try pressing the _[NC/AMBIENT]_ button to toggle through all the modes and also when, you are connected to any bluetooth
devices even computers(PC/Mac/Linux).
